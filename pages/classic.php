<h2>PAC Classic</h2>
<div class="well">
	<p>
		PAC Classic is our sub-group dedicated to showing classic anime series, ovas, and movies. Whether you
		missed them the first time around or if you enjoy rewatching your favorite old shows, this is the place to be.
		The meetings will be held in Stewart Center, and the rooms are reserved for Monday nights from 6pm to 12am.
		Generally meetings start between 7 and 7:30 and have a 15-30 minute break after the first four shows. The
		schedule can change due to unforseen circumstances or technical issues. If you have any questions, e-mail us.
		We're always open to suggestions on what to show.
