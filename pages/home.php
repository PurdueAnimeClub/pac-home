						Tomorrow's meeting of Summer PAC will be starting at 7pm, but we will be in a different locale
						this week. Chuck has graciously volunteered to hold the meeting at his place so that we can
						experience the concert sequence in White Album S2 in full surround sound on an excellent sound
						system. Feel free to show up at 6pm as he is making teriyaki burgers. If you need a ride there,
						be sure to let me know. I'll be picking up people out in front of the Memorial Union at 6pm. If
						you're driving yourself, I'll be including information in the email for how to get to his place.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hope to see you there!
